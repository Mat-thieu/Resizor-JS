# Resizor

Resize elements on all corners and edges.


### Make an element resizable
```javascript
makeResizable('resize', {
	triggerMargin : 20
});
```

### Additions to future updates

- Give the option to set a maximum and/or minimum width and height
- Restrict some types resizing (e.g. only allow left and bottom)

Keep in mind that resizing in all directions allows a user to move an element across the page.
